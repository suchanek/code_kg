refactor: introduce layered OOP API and reorganize codebase

Replace flat module structure with a clean three-layer architecture:
- CodeGraph (graph.py): pure, cached AST extraction
- GraphStore (store.py): SQLite persistence, replaces codekg_sqlite.py
- SemanticIndex (index.py): pluggable LanceDB vector index, replaces codekg_lancedb.py
- CodeKG (kg.py): top-level orchestrator with typed result types
  (BuildStats, QueryResult, Snippet, SnippetPack)

Update __init__.py to expose the full public API at the package level
while preserving the locked v0 Node/Edge primitive contract.

Add comprehensive tests for each new layer (test_graph.py,
test_store.py, test_kg.py) and rename test_codekg_v0.py to
test_primitives.py to reflect its scope.

Add Architecture.md and rewrite README with full project documentation.
Add Claude agent configs (.claude/agents/) and command definitions
(.claude/commands/) to support AI-assisted development workflows.
